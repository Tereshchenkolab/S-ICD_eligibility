 ### Fully de-identified ECG data
 - fully de-identified raw digital ECG signal (.txt format) is provided for the study NCT03209726.
 - 15-lead ECG files: first 12 columns are routine 12-lead ECG data, and remaining 3 columns are unipolar 3-lead ECG data (as described in manuscript). 12-lead and 3-lead ECG were recorded simultaneously.
 - left standing and supine, and right standing and supine positions: 4 ECGs for each participant
 - Two zip folders contain 404 files (data of 101 participants)
